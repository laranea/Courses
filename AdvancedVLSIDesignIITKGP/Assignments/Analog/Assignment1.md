Simulate a fully differential amplifier with PMOS load.
Initially use L = 180nm for all transistors and W close to 1um.
Use biasing current =100uA.
Adjust the PMOS load such that the output DC level is Vdd/2.  
Change the W of both the PMOS transistors by 10% (increase both by 10%) and observe the new DC potential at the output.

Now use L = 2um for all transistors while maintaining the same W/L ratio.
Repeat the above part and check for the shift in output DC voltage at both
the outputs for change in W of PMOS.

Now construct a differential amplifier with current mirror load (L =2um for all)
and check the effect of change in W/L of PMOS device on the single ended output.

Note : The long term design assignment needs to be selected by today
          so that you can get started with either one of those assignments or follow
          instruction for a generic module.
