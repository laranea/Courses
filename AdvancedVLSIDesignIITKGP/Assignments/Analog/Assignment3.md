Use the 2-stage diffamp designed in assignment-2,apply common-mode feedback using single loop as discussed earlier.

(1)Assess the phase margin. Apply appropriate compensation so as to improve
the phase margin.

(2)Use voltage divider biasing for input of the amplifier and examine the output refered noise.

(3) Apply high resistance feedback where resistance is implemented using sub-vt transistors for input DC bias, Measure the effective resistance with the help of DC analysis. For this, you need to apply a DC voltage equal to the common mode DC bias (0.5Vdd) at both the terminals. Then sweep one of the sources within 100mV range and plot the current flowing through the transistors. Obtain the vale of voltage-difference/current as the resulting resistance value. Notice how the resistance changes with applied potential difference and determine the range for which it remains constant within on order of magnitude.

(4)Try to adjust the transistor size so that R=10G ohms is obtained for small potential difference.

(5)Again obtain the plot for the output referred noise while using the resistance designed above.

(6)Apply capacitive feedback to get a gain of 50. Obtain the frequency response of the resulting feedback amplifier.

(7)Observe the change in frequency response for a 10% change in Vt of PMOS constituting the high resistance.
